I want you to read the codebase of libkdv and a demo of using it. Based on the code you have read. Tell me what kdv_NewYork.compute() does and how compute() is performed (e.g., the underlying algorithm). And let me know what if I want to render a raster file with given the number of row pixels and column pixels and the values of density, how should I fit/convert my raster file (just density values with [#row, #column]) to the right one that can be proceed by KeplerGl and display on NewYork correctly?
